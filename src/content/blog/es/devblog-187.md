### Ukraine update by @juliancoffee

Despite everything, I am now writing this post from my home in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. And if at first people were betting how long Ukraine could stand, three days or three months, it's sixth month and it seems that Ukraine still alive üôÇ In 1994, Russian president Borist Yeltsin started First Chechen War and destroyed Grozny, in 1999 Russian prime minister and future president Vladimir Putin led Second Chechen War and occupied Ichkeria Republic, in 2008 Russian president Dmitry Medvedev invaded Georgia, in 2014 Russian president Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and in 2022 committed full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And now we have the chance to stop it, once and for all. Huge thanks to all people of the free world for support and huge thanks to Veloren community for sharing my story ‚ù§Ô∏è.

As always, here are some links to volunteer and charity organizations.
