This week has only the art section curated by @Pfau. I (@AngelOnFira) just got back from a trip, and I'm still getting back into the swing of things. Expect a much large dev blog next week! :)

_Char Selection Window: Right now everything is still pre rendered and layered images only. But in the future we plan to have the background and all the figures live rendered!_

_Char Creation Window: It all starts with choosing your race and Body Type._

_You'll be able to choose from one of the seven starting weapons, but more weapon types are waiting inside the game_

_Afterwards you'll be able to further customize your player character of course._

_Concept for the character creation. Every Race will have their own colours to pick from. The 'brightness' slider will give the last touch to it to make your character really unique_
