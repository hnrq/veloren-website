## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @Songtronix, @Pfau, @Sharp, @xMAC94x, @imbris, @termac, @black-silence, @AngelOnFira, @scottc, @zesterer, and @notoria!

This week, Airshipper 0.4.0 Released. Lots of small updates were made, which can be seen in the section below. @Gemu and @Slipped worked on improving the way quadrupeds run. New weapons were modeled by @Gemu and @Pfau. A healing sceptre is being worked on by @Sam and @Pfau. Lots of balancing changes were made so that the game would be easier for new players. This was an effort by @Scott, @Snowram, @Savvynik, and @Pfau.

Loot tables are now species independent. @Sharp has been working on small tasks, including driver debugging, moving figure meshing to the background, refactoring config data out of Rust, and significantly improving the speed of terrain collision detection.

Notable changes to Airshipper 0.4.0:

- Uses the same font as Veloren
- Option to retry if download/install failed
- Offline support
- Screenshots, logs, game saves all centralized in profile folder
- No more terminal window floating around if you just want to play
- And a ton more...
