This week, we have another code reading club to watch. Work is being done on pet healing, and how sites are placed.

## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @imbris, @ninefox, @Slipped, @ubruntu, @InfRandomness, @zesterer, @bwerf, @xMAC94x, @inojelis, @Sam, @floppy!

@ubruntu got players to now heal their pets as well as themselves when sitting at a campfire. @tormeh has been working on sites. Giant trees, castles, towns, and other sites should now be placed more appropriately, both in regards to terrain and each other.

### Veloren Reading Club #6

This week, another reading club was recorded! In this one, we learned about some internals of Git, and how to move around different workflows. We also learned about how the economy sim for Veloren is designed.
