### LoD Objects by @zesterer

I've been working on an LoD object system. The obvious first candidate for this system are trees.

The LoD system pre-generates the position and kind of trees (and other objects) on the server, but not the models themselves (doing so would be very costly). This allows Voxygen to add a cheap placeholder model. At a distance, these look sufficiently like the real thing to be passable. The net effect is that the scale of distant terrain is more obvious. I've also been very surprised by just how many trees Veloren's world has!
