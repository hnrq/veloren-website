**Read this if you own a server on the servebrowser list!**

Player counts have been a long-requested feature for the server browser in Airshipper, and we're finally close to releasing them!

The query server, which allows for clients to query status information about a server, was already merged 5 months ago. Soon, Airshipper will also make use of it do display more accurate ping information, player counts, version information and the global battlemode.

Important info for server owners
--------------------------------

While this feature is enabled by default for new servers, it requires a bit of manual work for existing servers.

If you own a server on the serverbrowser list, please read the following issue on gitlab for more information: [https://gitlab.com/veloren/serverbrowser/-/issues/103](https://gitlab.com/veloren/serverbrowser/-/issues/103)

You will find a short guide explaining how to enable the query server, please add your comment once it is enabled!
