## Contributor Work

Thanks to this week's contributors, @XVar, @aweinstock, @xMAC94x, @tygyh, @imbris, @Treeco, @Capucho, @Sam, and @James!

Veloren is running an [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) leaderboard! Advent of Code is a programming challenge that takes place in the first 25 days of December every year. Every day at 00:00 EST, a new challenge is released. If you want to join the Veloren leaderboard, stop by the `##advent-of-code` channel on Discord to get the code!

This week, @Pfau and @Sam have been working on adding ability selection.

There have also been ongoing experiments with the new site system, which has been attracting a lot of attention since the first Veloren Reading Club. Below, we can see some trials done by @James.

### Veloren Reading Club #2: Spots and Worldgen Layers

If you missed it, we ran another Veloren Reading Club last week! In this one, we explore how the spots system works to place things around the world, and how the layers of worldgen are set up.
