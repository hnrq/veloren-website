## High quality upscaling by @zesterer

For those that run Veloren with a low internal resolution, I made some changes that might improve the game for you:

Firstly, I realised that the way we applied FXAA at internal resolutions other than 1.0x was incorrect. After fixing this, FXAA does its job more effectively at lower internal resolutions.

Secondly, I added a HQX anti-aliasing option (although technically, it's less anti-aliasing and more upscaling). It attempts to take the low resolution framebuffer generated by the game and perform edge detection to reconstruct the original geometry. It's by no means perfect, but I personally much prefer it over both no anti-aliasing and FXAA at very low internal resolutions.

Here's a comparison at 0.25x internal resolution between no-AA, FXAA, and HQX:
